I have been on both sides of the table—giving interviews to secure a good job and conducting interviews to recruit talented individuals. Both roles come with their own set of challenges.

Some people tend to exaggerate the problems on one side without understanding the other, which can lead to a negative overall perspective. This perception can amplify the issues and affect well-being. This article seeks to find solutions and raise awareness by examining both perspectives: a candidate hunting for a job and a recruiter seeking an employee.

## The Challenges of Concurrent Job Applications

Due to the high uncertainty in the job market, candidates often apply to many positions, and recruiters review numerous applicants. This concurrent nature is driven by the difficulty of finding the perfect match and securing a desired role. Changing this dynamic is unlikely.

## Matching Person P with Company C

From application to offer, there is significant variability. A successful match ensures that the candidate appreciates the company’s culture and role, while the company values the candidate’s skills and behavior.

Instead of focusing solely on evaluation and then judgment, the best approach is for both parties to put themselves first and engage in deep, honest discussions. This means candidates should clearly communicate their needs, expectations, and aspirations, while recruiters should be transparent about what the role and company can offer. This mutual honesty helps in finding a true fit and reduces the mental battle of uncertainties.

### Phases of the Recruitment Process

For this to work effectively, other processes must be strong as well:

## Why Third Parties Cannot Solve This Problem

A third party can never solve this problem because the nuances of both the candidate's and the recruiter's needs and expectations are too complex and personalized. Third parties often lack the deep understanding and connection necessary to foster the level of transparency required for a successful match. They may provide tools and platforms to facilitate the process, but the integrity, honesty, and alignment of expectations must come directly from the involved parties.

## Practical Advice for Candidates and Recruiters

### For Candidates:
1. **Be Transparent**: Clearly communicate your needs, expectations, and aspirations.
2. **Prepare Well**: Optimize your profile and research the company thoroughly.
3. **Be Proactive**: Stay engaged and prompt in your communications.

### For Recruiters:
1. **Be Direct**: Ask the main problems and address them clearly.
2. **Be Transparent**: Offer clear information about the role, team dynamics, and compensation.
3. **Communicate Promptly**: Keep candidates informed about timelines and any changes in the process.

## Conclusion

A transparent interview process with clear information and ETAs at each stage is essential. This integrity must come from both the company and the candidate to improve the recruitment experience. By prioritizing honest and deep discussions over mere evaluation, both parties can better align their expectations and capabilities, leading to more successful and satisfying outcomes.
